# colophon — working notes

colophon is the Freely Given Books pipeline for early printed sources: an
EEBO-TCP or Evans transcription, or a CCEL text, becomes an enriched TEI
master with every editorial decision inline, and the TEI becomes Typst
chapters, a print PDF checked against Lulu's rules, and an EPUB 3. It was
built on William Perkins' *Christian Oeconomie* (1609, EEBO-TCP `A09377`)
and *The Anatomy of Simon Magus* (1700, `A25330`, a heavily edited edition
brought into the pipeline after it was finished), and grew with every book
since.

colophon works on a books repository (`books/<author>/<book>/`, the Typst
templates in `typst/fgbooks-typst`), where it is checked out as the
`colophon/` submodule; `library.py` says how it finds that repository.
Paths below are from the books repository's root. Run it through that
repository's `./fgb`. Notes on the books themselves (where texts come from,
the editor's preferences, the review) are in the books repository's
`CLAUDE.md`.

## Architecture: TEI is the master, Typst is a view

```

`tei_epub.py` gets its XHTML from `tei_to_html.py`, which reuses
`tei_extract.py`'s renderer (the `R` class; its
output methods `esc`/`emph`/`sup`/`footnote` are what the HTML subclass
overrides), so the ebook and the Typst chapters cannot drift apart.

- The **untouched TCP file** is provenance. Never edit it.
- The **enriched TEI** holds the 1609 text *and* every editorial decision
  inline, so one file yields either reading:
  - `<choice><orig>mariage</orig><reg resp="#auto">marriage</reg></choice>` spelling
  - `<choice><orig>Heere</orig><reg resp="#editor">Here</reg><reg resp="#auto">Heer</reg></choice>`
    an editor overriding the machine (editor's reg first, machine's kept)
  - `<choice><abbr>fro̅</abbr><expan>from</expan></choice>` macron abbreviations,
    `y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>` → `the`
  - `<supplied reason="illegible" cert="high" resp="#auto">eu</supplied>`
    letters lost to bad print, with an XML comment giving the evidence and
    the TCP `<gap>` kept inside
  - `<list type="numbered" change="#review">` run-in "I. … II. …" set out as
    lists, printed numerals kept in `<label>`
  - `<head type="edition">` this edition's section title, printed head kept;
    `<head type="short">` its running-head form
  - `reg/@type`: spelling, case, punctuation, spacing, grammar (archaic
    forms modernized: thou, hath, -eth), emendation (another word, a word
    added or removed, a changed number; "wording" in `tei_review.py`); a `reg`
    may hold `<hi>` (italic words of the reading) and `<anchor>`s
  - notes: `note/@target` → `<anchor>` where the edition moved the note
    (it stays where it was printed for the orig layer);
    `note[@ana="#edition-only"]` added by the editor,
    `note[@ana="#print-only"]` dropped
  - `hi[@ana="#print-only"]` italic in print, roman in the edition;
    `hi[@ana="#edition-only"]` the other way round
  - `@prev`/`@next` blocks the edition runs together (both kept as printed);
    `p[@rend="quote"]` a paragraph the edition sets as a quotation;
    `p`/`q[@rend="inset"]` one it sets off, indented both sides (the review's
    `#block(inset: (x: 1em))[...]`); `p[@rend="center"]` centered in the
    source (CCEL's class="Centered"), `#align(center)[...]` in the edition;
    `trailer[@ana="#in-edition"]` a "FINIS." the edition keeps (one it
    leaves out is not aligned, so words added at the end are not lost)
  - lists the review shapes (Sibbes): `list/@rend` a numbering of its own
    (`"a)"`, `"I."`; the review's `#[ #set enum(numbering: ..., start: N) ... ]`),
    `item/@n` on the first item the number it starts from, an item or a
    paragraph the review indents under an item moved inside it, a paragraph
    run on into a list's last item moved there (`@prev`);
    `@rend="run-on"` a block run on with no space between;
    `epigraph[@rend="quote"]` / `q[@rend="quote"]` set as `#quote[...]`
  - a closer with a dateline or several signatories is set one line each,
    signatories first (orig layer: as printed)
  - headings the edition adds (Brooks, `EDITION_HEADINGS`):
    `label[@type="head"][@n=level][@ana="#edition-only"]` before the block
    they stand over; the review's `=` lines below the file title
  - `lg[@rend="paragraphs"]` verse set a line to a paragraph;
    `item[@rend="paragraph"]` a printed item set as a paragraph;
    `list[@type="bulleted"]` a bullet list the review makes;
    `list[@rend="inline"]` a printed list run into its sentence;
    `CLOSER_PLAIN` salutes and signatures as plain paragraphs (run on, split)
  - `SKIP_BLOCKS(root)` in `editorial.py`: loose blocks the edition leaves
    out (most of a long dedication), kept in the TEI; a layout file's
    `"part"` is a part page before it in the ebook
  - a layout file's `"subtitle"`: a printed head set as a centred line under
    the title (Bunyan's preface dedication), aligned like a paragraph
  - Gouge: `head[@prev]` a printed head the edition runs on into the
    paragraph before (a sentence the TCP made a heading); `head[@next]` a
    run-in head (`RUN_IN_DIVS`) set as its paragraph's opening words, not
    bold; `p[@rend="epigraph"]` a paragraph holding a scripture text set
    as an epigraph (the review's centred `#align(center)[ #block ...]`);
    `cell[@rend="nested"]` a brace branch set under the branch before;
    `table[@rend="inline"]` a brace read into one sentence; blocks the
    review deletes whole (margin matter moved into a note) stay, emptied,
    and the paragraph runs on past them
- The header (`editorialDecl`, `respStmt`, `revisionDesc`) documents the
  rules and who `#auto` / `#editor` are. It validates against `tei_all`.
- **Typst is replaceable.** Anything that reads XML can produce LaTeX, HTML
  or EPUB from the same file.

## CCEL (ThML) sources

**CCEL** (ccel.org; first book: Spurgeon, *All of Grace*). Take the ThML,
not the plain text: `https://www.ccel.org/ccel/<letter>/<author>/<work>.xml`
(e.g. `.../s/spurgeon/grace.xml`), kept untouched as
`source/<work>.thml.xml`. It plays the TCP file's part: every tool reads the
source through `colophon/sources.py`, which converts ThML in memory with
`thml_to_tei.py` (div1 → chapter, blockquote/verse → `quote`, scripRef →
`ref[@cRef]`, the title page → `front/titlePage`), so there is no converted
copy. The text is kept exactly; CCEL has no page or line information, and
the header says the TEI is paragraph-faithful. A modern text sets
`MODERNIZE = False` (no early-modern spelling or case rules) and
`TYPOGRAPHY = True` (ASCII quotes curled as Typst curls them, `--` as
`DASH`, as `#auto` punctuation readings), and `QUOTE_BLOCK = True` when
the print template sets `#quote` as a block (the ebook uses `<blockquote>`).

*The Pilgrim's Progress* (`.../b/bunyan/pilgrim.xml`, both parts) added:
div2/div3 → nested `div[@type="section"]` (the layout cuts files from
them), CCEL's contents and index divs (`SKIP_DIVISIONS`, which may also
name `titlePage`), a paragraph opening with a small-caps "Name:" →
`sp/speaker` + `p` (dialogue, as TCP texts encode it; rendered
"Christian: …"), other small caps → `seg[@rend="smallcaps"]` (`SMALLCAPS =
"strong"` sets them bold, for a font without small capitals), late
headings → `signed`, and footnotes. `VERSE_LINEBREAKS = True` sets verse
line by line (and keeps CCEL's `<br/>`); in a division that is mostly verse
(`layout.verse_division`: the Apology, the Conclusion) stanzas are plain
paragraphs, not `#quote`s.

## Commands

`./fgb` (`fgb.py`; `./fgb --help`) is the day-to-day command; the books
repository's `CLAUDE.md` lists its uses.

The Typst templates (`@local/fgbooks:X.Y.Z`, `@local/fgbooksLBCF:...`) are
tags in the `typst/fgbooks-typst` submodule; `./fgb` unpacks the imported
versions into `~/.cache/fgb-typst/packages` and sets `TYPST_PACKAGE_PATH`
(`colophon/packages.py`; `./fgb packages` lists them). Run Typst through
`./fgb`, or set that variable, so builds use the pinned versions.

Print PDFs are checked against Lulu's interior rules as they are built
(`colophon/print_check.py`, measured on the rendered pages): nothing
within 0.5in of the trim (running heads and page numbers included), and
the inside margin Lulu's for the page count (0.625in for 61-150 pages, 1in
for 151-400, 1.125in for 401-600). It also warns when a footnote's text is set on
another page than its marker (Typst's widow control can carry the marker's
line over after placing the note; a crowded page can push the note on). Template 0.5.3 puts the running head at
0.5in (top margin 0.9in, bottom 0.6in); 0.5.4 keeps level 3/4 headings with
their text; the trim is 5.5x8.5 unless a book sets `page-width`/`page-height`.
A book sets its inside margin in `page-margin`. A cover
(`scripts/panel_cover.typ` in the books repository) is compiled with its
interior's page count and trim (`--input pages=N trim-width=W
trim-height=H`; `interior_of` pairs `cover-vol-2.typ` with `...-vol-2.typ`),
so its spine, Lulu's `pages / 444 + 0.06in`, cannot go stale.

The underlying scripts, for anything else, run in colophon's environment
(`colophon/.venv`, which uv keeps to `uv.lock`; any `./fgb` run or
`uv sync --project colophon` makes it), written `$PY` here:

```sh
PY=$PWD/colophon/.venv/bin/python     # from the books repository's root

```

There used to be a Typst-native reader, `tei.typ`
(`#tei-division(xml(...), 1)`). It matched `tei_extract.py` for Perkins but
never learned the later encodings, so it was removed; it is in git history
(commit f1a3e0e) if Typst ever needs to read the TEI directly again.

Book settings live in the book's `source/editorial.py`, next to the TCP
and TEI files, read by `build_tei.py`, `tei_extract.py` and
`tcp_structure.py`: `MACRON_M`, `GAP_FIXES`, `LOWERCASE_COMMON_NOUNS`,
`REPORT_NOTES`, `SKIP_DIVISIONS` (printed divisions the edition leaves out),
`TYPST_PREAMBLE` and `TYPST_HEADING` (e.g. `"#chapter[{title}][{short}]"`
for a book with its own heading macro), `LAYOUT`/`DIV_LEVELS`/`RUN_IN_DIVS`
(any other shape, see `layout.py`). Machine-pass switches, all off by
default (Gouge turns them on): `SPELLING` (the book's own words over the
shared table, e.g. "domestical"), `MODERNIZE_NOTES`, `LATIN_RUNS` (Latin
found per run of 4+ words and left as printed), `DROP_FOREIGN_GAPS`,
`GAP_NOTES` (text for a missing-pages or unrestorable gap), `EXPAND_ETC`
("&c." -> "etc."), `DROP_CAP_CASE` ("AS there" -> "As there") and
`ITALIC_SENTENCE_QUIRK` (`True`, the Perkins/Simon Magus rule; Gouge
`"after-stop"`). A `GAP_FIXES` entry may carry a fourth item, the resp
(`"#editor"` for a gap filled by hand).

Tables are read the way early printers meant them (`layout.table_reading`):
a brace (a cell spans rows) column by column, labels as lines and branches
as a `+` list; a row-wise table row by row; a table interrupting its
sentence inline. A paragraph is split around a block table or list. The
machine records the tidying (item numbers, trailing commas, capitals, the
closing stop) as readings.

## Review workflow

The reviewed Typst chapters remain a fine place to edit. To read the
edition against the printed text, generate `side-by-side.html` with
`tei_review.py` (above); it is read-only, and it shows which
`chapters/typ` file to edit. Re-run
`build_tei.py --review chapters/typ`: it aligns the reviewed text against
the machine pass token by token and records every difference as an
`#editor` decision (macron n/m fixes and filled-in gaps are recognized as
such). Body text and footnotes are aligned separately and notes are paired
by position and text, so a note can be rewritten, moved, added or dropped.
It also carries italics (`_…_`, `#emph[…]`), the review's exact spacing,
paragraph splits and merges, a printed "I." turned into a `+ ` item,
`#quote[…]` blocks and `#chapter[long][short]` headings. Pure layout
(`#linebreak()`, `#pagebreak()`, `#par(...)`) is not text and is not
stored, so it does not belong in `chapters/typ` at all: `./fgb check`
requires `chapters/typ` to be exactly what the TEI gives back (`//`
comment lines aside), so print and ebook cannot drift apart. Formatting
the edition wants is a TEI encoding (centered, inset, epigraph, closer) or
a template rule (headings kept with their text, fgbooks 0.5.4), never a
per-book command. The extractor writes italics as a person types them
(`#emph[We ought]`, a footnote after the run, not in it: `tidy_emph`), and
an epigraph's reference may come before the verse ("EPHES. 6. 9.") or
after it ("— Matthew 6:6"). `//` comment lines are ignored. The report
lists every decision and anything it could not apply.

**Bringing in a finished book** (Simon Magus): put the TCP file in
`source/`, give `editorial.py` the book's heading template, build with the
finished chapters as `--review`, and prove the round trip before replacing
anything: `colophon/compare.py chapters` (words, notes, italics,
headings), then compile the print book from the old and the extracted
chapters and run `compare.py pdf` (spacing-sensitive) and `cmp` on
`pdftotext -layout` (every line and page), and `compare.py epub` against
the old ebook. Only then replace `chapters/typ` with the extraction.

For *Christian Oeconomie* the reg extraction reproduces the reviewed
chapters byte for byte, except the `#linebreak()` in chapter 5 (layout). A
damaged list in the review copy of chapter 5 was rebuilt from the source
and copied back into `chapters/typ`.

## Hard-won lessons

1. **Words span inline markup.** `ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill`,
   `fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>`, `cu<gap/>ome`,
   `<seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hristian`, `y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>`.
   `teitok.py` tokenizes a TEI element losslessly into words that can
   contain such elements (tested: rebuild without changes is byte-identical
   to the source), so a `<choice>` can wrap the whole word.
2. **Pretty-print whitespace is not a space** when it sits between two
   `g`/`gap` siblings or is an element's leading text before a `g`/`gap`.
   Treating it as a space gives "con sent", "cu stome". The enriched file
   drops it inside words so consumers need no heuristics; `tei_extract.py`
   still guards against it for raw TCP input.
3. **Macron abbreviations are ambiguous** (n or m). `MACRON_M` in the
   book's `source/editorial.py` lists, by document order, the ones that are m; everything
   else is n. Build it per book by reading each occurrence. The review
   caught 9 wrong ones here (fron→from, conmonly→commonly); those are now
   `<expan resp="#editor">`.
4. **Illegible gaps can mostly be reconstructed** from Bible quotations,
   Latin legal maxims and context (`GAP_FIXES`, with certainty and
   evidence). Use the document's *own* spelling for the letters ("euery",
   not "every"; check word frequencies). Greek/Hebrew and citation digits
   need the page image — the editor filled 8 of those by hand.
5. **The machine keeps grammatical archaisms** (hath, doth, thou, thee,
   thy, ye, shalt, wilt, art, hast, dost): different words, not spellings.
   An edition may still modernize them (Simon Magus does: hath → has, thou
   → you); those are editor decisions (`reg[@type="grammar"]`), never
   `spelling.py` entries.
   Footnotes stay in original spelling in the machine pass (abbreviations
   expanded only).
6. **Sentence case rules are legacy-compatible on purpose**: first word of
   a paragraph or after . ! ? is capitalized; an italic boundary right
   after a full stop does *not* start a sentence (so "…do.] vers. 26." stays
   lowercase); a short list of common nouns is lowercased mid-sentence;
   roman numerals are left alone. Changing these rules would make an
   unreviewed rebuild differ from what was reviewed.
7. **spelling.py** is Perkins' engine merged (2026) with Gouge's: a
   letterform search (u/v and i/j swapped until the dictionary knows the
   word), more silent-e/doubled-letter patterns, `NAMES` (checked first; a
   table entry beats `DO_NOT_TOUCH`), a large `LATIN_SKIP`. Merging moved
   some Perkins/Simon Magus decisions between `#auto` and `#editor`; the
   rendered text did not change. **spelling.py misses** found by the review (bee→be ×78, lawes→laws,
   Prou→Prov, Heere→Here, bin→been, dais→days, yong→young, reade→read,
   shew→show, KJV name forms like Isaak→Isaac, Thar→Terah…) are
   now in `spelling.py`'s `MANUAL` (so this book's TEI credits them to
   `#auto`; its report is down to 8 spelling decisions, mostly in notes,
   which stay in original spelling). Context-dependent ones were left out
   (harts/hearts, Tigres, Corinthes). `bee`→`be` is a known risk: it
   mangles "Bee-hive", which the editor layer here overrides.
8. **Typst `xml()` gotchas** (from the removed `tei.typ`): paths resolve relative to the
   file that calls `xml()`, so load the XML in the book file and pass it
   in; `while` loops hit an iteration limit on a whole book, use recursion;
   adjacent string pieces keep double spaces (collapse them yourself);
   markup drops the space before `#footnote[...]` but strings don't; smart
   apostrophes are applied to markup, not strings.
9. **TEI validation**: `tei_all.rng` is on GitHub
   (`TEIC/TEI-Simple`), tei-c.org is often unreachable; validate with jing
   (`relaxng/jing-trang` releases); keep both in `~/.cache/fgb-tei`,
   where `verify.py` finds them. lxml's RelaxNG is too slow for
   `tei_all`. `@resp` is not allowed on `list`/`head` in that schema, hence
   `@change="#review"`.
10. **EPUB checking**: `epubcheck book.epub` (installed, needs Java); both
   EPUBs pass with 0 errors and 0 warnings. Calibre's own checker is a
   second opinion that runs headless:
   `calibre-debug colophon/check_epub.py book.epub` (ignore the Qt/GPU
   noise it prints).
11. **Check the rendered text, not just the tokens.** A comparison of
   parsed words is blind to spacing: Simon Magus matched word for word
   while printing "natura( of" for "natura (of" — the editor had turned a
   comma into "(" but the space after the comma was still in the source.
   The review parser now records the review's spaces, readings are joined
   with them, and a spacing pass records each added or removed space as a
   `reg[@type="spacing"]` choice. `compare.py pdf` catches the rest.
12. **Typst reads `#emph[x](y)` as a call** with more arguments, and a `;`
   straight after a call (`#emph[x];`) ends it and is swallowed, so the
   semicolon never prints. Any `(`, `[` or `;` straight after a markup call is
   escaped (`\(`, `\;`) by `tei_extract.py`;
   check against everything rendered so far, since an empty text part can
   sit in between.
13. **1700 printings differ from 1609 ones**: long s (`ſ`) throughout and
   `<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>` for capital U are letter forms, normalized by
   the machine pass (not spelling decisions); nouns are capitalized
   mid-sentence (the review lowercases them: thousands of `case`
   decisions, which `LOWERCASE_COMMON_NOUNS` could move to the machine);
   margin notes sit at the start of a quotation, and a modern edition
   moves them to its end.
14. **A `<q>` in a division can hold `<p>`s.** Only a quotation with text
   directly inside counts as a block; one made of paragraphs is walked
   into, and merges attach to the innermost paragraph.
15. **Quotes are curled per paragraph in the ebook**, after rendering,
   because an italic name and a roman "'s" are separate fragments
   (per-fragment curling gave "Simon‘s"), and only once a run-on block has
   joined (`finish()` in `tei_to_html.py`). The rule is Typst's own: it
   remembers open quotes, so `sacrificed,' wisdom` opens and `beasts,'`
   closes. The same rule makes a straight apostrophe inside a single
   quotation (`'You are Christ's,'`) close it, so a book quoting with
   single quotes types its apostrophes as `’` in `chapters/typ`.
16. **Pages missing from the transcribed copy** come from another copy as a
   supplement, `source/<ID>.supplied.xml` beside the TCP file, which
   `sources.load()` splices in at the gap for every tool (Gouge pp.
   191-196). The gap stays, filled empty in `GAP_FIXES` so no index shifts;
   brought-in blocks carry `@change` pointing at a revisionDesc entry naming
   the copy; new sections shift a layout's ordinal section ranges
   (`edition.json`).
